Due: 2021-02-04

Points available: 15

### node.js, express, cookie-parser

* Install node.js, express, and cookie-parser on your local machine

### set up a server 

* Set up and run a server on your local machine
* Install three "paths" on your server, with each path corresponding to a favorite artist, musician, film, or TV series.  For example, my paths might be:
   * localhost:4000/djshadow
   * localhost:4000/game-of-thrones.html
   * localhost:4000/Ozark
* For each path, have a sentence or two in HTML that explains why this is a favorite of yours

### Youtube video

* Record your screen of you 1) viewing the files, 2) starting the server, 3) loading each of the three paths in your browser.  
* Upload that video to Youtube (see [week 1 slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EZomYYzDeLNzCOlTsFUWgVHUhuiCGgXPY8G3r-i_Yic/edit) for details).

### Put files in your forked repo, issue a Pull Request to my repo

* In your local repo, create:

```
mkdir assignments/YourLastName/1
```

For example, for me it would be:

```
mkdir assignments/Nelson/1
```

* In this directory, upload all of your *.html, *.js, and a README.md file that documents the assignment and includes a link to the Youtube video.  You MUST include a README.md file.  

* When finished, use GitHub to issue a Pull Request to my repo (see [week 1 slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EZomYYzDeLNzCOlTsFUWgVHUhuiCGgXPY8G3r-i_Yic/edit) for details).

### 2 points extra credit available

* install and demonstrate a favicon.ico for your site
